# CellCanvas

CellCanvas is a tool for building geometric models of cellular
architecture from images.

CellCanvas combines machine learning with interactive visualization to
facilitate the creation of geometric representations of cellular architectures.

## What can CellCanvas do?

- interactive segmentation when there is no ground truth
- extract complex geometries

## Modalities

CellCanvas currently supports:

- CryoET
